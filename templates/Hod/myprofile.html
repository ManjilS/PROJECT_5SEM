      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        It was a grand vision & mission of our beloved founder member and Principal Late Prof. Dr. Deepak Bhattarai and other six prominent founders, 
        to provide opportunities of technical education in Nepal to the students of our country. Since its establishment in 1994 the institute has taken 
        giant strides and reached today’s position. It is a matter of great pride that our Institute has been bestowed with a permanent affiliation status
         by the Nepal Engineering Council for all the eligible Engineering courses being run in nec. This became possible due to the sustained support and 
         encouragement provided by our founders, also the hard work done by the teachers’ staff and the blessings from all our stakeholders, parents/guardians
         and alumni. Known for quality education, discipline, eco-friendly campus, concern for society and environment, nec has carved a niche for itself in 
         the field of technical education in Nepal. With a proud legacy of 29 years, the institute has excelled in every field. The students who graduated
         from this institute are occupying prestigious positions in the organizations of national and international repute. Our aim is to transform the students
         into rational thinkers, problem solver, competent technocrats and managers, law abiding citizens and spiritually enlightened individuals and also to 
         inculcate social and moral values, sportsmanship, compassion for nature, pride for our culture and traditions. This is our firm belief that the rich
         values and traditions imbibed here would carry our students to greater heights. We believe that in this era of knowledge society, our students must 
         be equipped with an appropriate knowledge, habits, attitudes and morals leading to holistic development. The students must participate in the co-curricular
         and extracurricular activities to facilitate the process of creative and critical thinking. I earnestly believe that our institute provides ample 
         opportunities for developing and shaping the personalities of the students.
